Handy Python scripts to help me do things...

<h2>Scrape_Courses_FCCC.py</h2>
A script I wrote to create semester course schedules for the Geosciences Dept. at U-Mass Amherst via scraping the Five College Consortium Course Catalog, which is a lot easier to work with than U-Mass's own internal enterprise course catalog system.  If you use this script please scrape politely and responsibly.

<h2>dept_calendar_date_generator.py</h2>

Say you have a recurring event on a particular day of the week.  This script gives you a list of calendar dates for that event.
